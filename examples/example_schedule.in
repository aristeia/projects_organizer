#  CSV file format: 
#    Each value of each line is represented as a "data type::description"
#    float::hours_estimate,int::month,int::day,string::class,string::project,string::assignment
#
#    For each 'class' of work, for each 'project' for that class, you will have one assignment for that project being assigned to work on at any one time, so that no two assignments within one project type are being worked on at once, and that you only work on the one due most soon at any time.
