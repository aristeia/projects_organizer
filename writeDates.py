# This file will write a 'dates.json' (or other file name, if specified in first cmd arg)
#   for projects.py to read in via the -D parameter
#
# The purpose of a dates.json is to weight how much work you want to do on certain types
#   of dates differently, based on either (1) the day of the week or (2) the date.
# If a specific date is found in this json file, projects.py will use that date's weight,
#   otherwise, if the date's weekday is found, projects.py will use that weekday's weight,
#   otherwise use 1 by default.
#
# Keys for weekdays are the integer 0-6 representing Monday-Sunday (just like date.weekday())
# Keys for dates are YYYYMMDD for year, month, and day
# Values are rational numbers GREATER THAN ZERO, such that, for a value X, you will work X 
#   times more than usual for a usual workload, hence, make this number less than 1 for 
#   days where you'd like to work less than usual, and greater than 1 for more than usual
# For now, if you don't want to work on a day, use a very small positive weight like 0.01
